# Sudoku Backend
This project will be hosted soon, but you can test it by doing the following:

1. Follow instructions in [sudoku](https://github.com/JulianAR97/sudoku) ReadMe
2. Clone this repository
3. Run `bundle install`
4. Run `rails db:create`
5. Run `rails db:migrate`
6. Run `rails s`

## Important!
**The default port for the rails server is 3001 because the React frontend runs on port 3000.  If you need to change the port for any reason, you must also change the port for all of the fetch calls in the actions directory of the frontend project**
